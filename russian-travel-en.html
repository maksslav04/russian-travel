      <p class="intro__text">According to ARCSPO polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to
        spend a vacation in their native country. Like, what haven't we seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole
        universe with the gentle sea of the south, the dense forests of the Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the
        Putorana plateau. And you can also see all these beauties without millions on your account, a passport and many
        hours of flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova — a brave young mother who took three children in her arms,
        sat them in her Lada and drove 20 thousand kilometers across her native country. We have selected and described
        some interesting places worthy of your vacation.</p>

            the calm Curonian Lagoon on one side and the rippling waves of the Baltic Sea on the other. A unique natural
            area on the edge of the Russian enclave.</p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">The Kaliningrad Region does not end there. For the traveler and explorer, there is
            the westernmost point of Russia, the Baltic Spit, in the same neighborhood, and the German heritage of
            placers of small seaside towns. The atmosphere of these places eliminates the hustle and bustle, plunging
            into the tranquility of nature and the smell of the steel, cool sea.</p>

          <p class="place__paragraph">You may have watched Zvyagintsev and even heard the story of the Arctic festival
            in Teriberka. Perhaps the word "Khibiny" did not remain under the snow of school memories of geography
            lessons. Perhaps you were not interested in the ultra-deep well penetrating the earth's crust, and apathy
            has been covering you for a long time. But your dream of seeing the Northern lights begins to come true with
            a ticket to Murmansk.</p>

          <p class="place__paragraph">Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of all, because of the
            mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and
            lakes. And if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these
            places — mountain air.</p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is temperate, so it's best to go here in summer. So you will
            see all the diversity of the local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the
            ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.

            is the largest source of fresh water and one of the most beautiful places in Russia.</p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for skioring
            competitions. This is a kind of sport when a skier ties himself to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to
            develop as much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019, a world record of 197.011 km/h was set at the
            Baikal Mile Festival.</p>

            taiga does not grow west of the Water Lake. But here it reaches 30 meters — the forests of Karelian national
            parks have never known an axe because of impassable swamps. Some pines are already more than half a
            millennium old. Touch a living being who saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it. In the virgin forest,
            you will not find a trail for a hundred kilometers. And on rare paths, trees a couple of meters from the
            ground are marked with bear claws. So that everyone knows who is the boss here.</p>
